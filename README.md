# mobile_price_prediction
My course project for Data Science &amp; Machine Learning (DSE302/ECS308) made during Spring Semester 2021-22, under the guidance of Amisha Srivastava &amp; Dr. Tanmay Basu, at IISER Bhopal.
\newline It works on a simple dataset containing 2000 rows of information on various specifications &amp; features of mobile phones, spread across 20 columns.
\newline The project uses pre-existing &amp; well-known Machine Learning models, tuned according to the data for predicting a range of their price, i.e. cheap, affordable, moderate &amp; expensive.
